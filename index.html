            Every year as the Hajj pilgrimage concludes, Muslims will arrange
            for the sacrifice of an animal to mark the celebration of Eid
            al-Adha. Qurbani, also referred to as Udhiyya in Arabic, means
            sacrifice and is an important rite in the Islamic religion.

                A camel is an even-toed ungulate in the genus Camelus that bears
                distinctive fatty deposits known as "humps" on its back. Camels
                have long been domesticated and, as livestock, they provide food
                and textiles

                means that their hooves split neatly down the middle.

            Qurbani is an annual tradition for Muslims across the world and
            involves an animal sacrifice in recognition of the Prophet Ibrahim’s
            (AS) own willingness to sacrifice his son for the will of Allah
            (SWT). At the last moment, Allah (SWT) replaced Ibrahim’s (AS) son
            with a ram, saving his life and rewarding Ibrahim’s (AS) devotion.
            <br /><br />
            Qurbani sacrifices must be given in three shares - one for you, one
            for family or friends and one for the poor and needy

            The primary purpose of salah is to act as a person's communication
            with Allah. <br />
            <br />
            [16] Purification of the heart is the ultimate religious objective
            of salah. Via salah, a believer can grow closer to Allah and in turn
            strengthen their faith; it is believed that the soul requires prayer
            and closeness to God to stay sustained and healthy, and that prayer
            spiritually sustains the human soul.[17]
